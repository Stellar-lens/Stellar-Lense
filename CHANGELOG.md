## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Reviewer checklists for high-risk changes**: [`docs/review-checklists.md`](docs/review-checklists.md) gives short, actionable per-item gates for the five change categories most likely to introduce a real vulnerability or silent breaking change: governance (signer thresholds, time-locked proposals, dispute accounting), cryptography (constant-time comparisons, commit-reveal scoping, domain separation), storage (`DataKey*` append-only stability — which, unlike `Error`, has no CI guard today — bounded collections, TTL tier placement), upgrades (delay enforcement, veto path, reproducible builds, version-bump changelog discipline), and composability (gate ABI stability, `supports_interface` documentation, struct field append-only rules). Each checklist links out to the existing deep-dive doc or audit it's distilled from rather than re-explaining it. Referenced from `CONTRIBUTING.md` (top-of-file pointer + a new "Submitting a Pull Request" bullet) and `README.md`. Closes #769.
- **Glossary**: [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md) defines every load-bearing term used across README.md and docs/ against the actual implementation — score, confidence, model version, shard, attestation, pause, finality, rent, and ~20 more. Several terms (**shard**, **finality**, **attestation**, **pause**) are explicitly flagged as meaning something narrower or different here than general blockchain usage would suggest (e.g. "shard" is a peer `ledgerlens-score` contract instance registered with the aggregator, not blockchain state sharding; "finality buffer" is a score-submission escrow window, not ledger-close finality). Cross-referenced from `README.md` (Overview) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (opening line + a new Guidelines bullet asking contributors to use glossary terms consistently and add new ones there rather than letting them go undefined). Closes #770.
- **Repository invariants document**: [`docs/invariants.md`](docs/invariants.md) lists the non-negotiable contract behaviors — fail-closed gates, no-panic reads, bounded storage, and append-only event/error stability — with pointers to exactly what code, tests, and CI enforce each one. Cross-referenced from `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. While writing it, found and documented (without silently fixing, since each requires its own compatibility-aware follow-up) several concrete gaps: `query_risk_gate_relative` is the one gate function that's fallible (`Result<bool, Error>`) rather than infallible `bool`, and isn't flagged as an exception anywhere; there's no fuzz/adversarial test suite for the read/gate path (unlike `submit_score`); five `supports_interface` capability symbols (`hpag`, `var`, `histogram`, `rgate`, `dprv`) are live but undocumented in both the in-code table and `docs/interface-spec.md`; and `pair_weight_reset` (unlike every other event) doesn't carry `EVENT_VERSION` in its topics, a real violation of the append-only event invariant that went undetected because the existing schema-version test never triggers `bulk_reset_pair_weight`. Added a deliberately-failing regression test (`test_pair_weight_reset_carries_schema_version` in `event_emission.rs`) proving that last one rather than leaving it as an unverified claim. Closes #768.
- **Interface versioning & migration policy**: [`docs/interface-versioning-policy.md`](docs/interface-versioning-policy.md) defines breaking vs. non-breaking changes, a 30-day notice period for breaking releases, and programmatic detection via `supports_interface`. Cross-referenced from `docs/interface-spec.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Closes #418.
- **`get_admin_set`**: Read-only query returning the current M-of-N admin co-signer set, mirroring `get_admin_signers`. Closes #239.
- **Rustdoc examples**: Added runnable usage examples for `get_hysteresis_margin` (closes #229) and `get_staleness_window` (closes #227).
- **Parameter Change Governance**: Added `propose_parameter_change`, `execute_parameter_change`, and `veto_parameter_change` for time-locked admin parameter changes with service-signer veto during the first half of the delay window. Supports cooldown, history depth, decay rate, velocity cap, and upgrade delay parameters. See [`docs/governance.md`](docs/governance.md).
- **Mock AMM liquidity gate**: `contracts/mock-amm` adds `provide_liquidity_gated`, `set_risk_oracle`, and confidence-aware gate configuration. See [`examples/amm_gate_example.rs`](examples/amm_gate_example.rs).
- **Batch submit benchmarks**: Criterion suite in `contracts/ledgerlens-score/benches/batch_submit.rs` measuring throughput and Soroban budget cost at batch sizes 1, 10, 50, and 100. Results uploaded as CI artifacts on merge to `main`.
- **Rent-sweep benchmarks**: Criterion suite in `contracts/ledgerlens-score/benches/rent_sweep.rs` measuring `get_expiring_entries` cost at tracked-entry-set sizes 0, 100, and 500. Closes #422.
- **Batch-attested benchmarks**: Criterion suite in `contracts/ledgerlens-score/benches/batch_attested.rs` measuring `submit_scores_batch_attested` cost at the same batch sizes as `batch_submit.rs` (1, 10, 50, 100), for direct comparison against plain `submit_scores_batch`. Confirms the lazy score-TTL extension below already applies to the attested path unmodified (both batch entry points call the same `storage::set_score`), and that `verify_merkle_proof`'s per-entry cost scales with tree depth (`O(log batch size)`, capped at `MAX_MERKLE_PROOF_DEPTH` = 30), not batch size. Closes #419.

### Changed
- **Lazy score TTL extension**: `set_score` now skips `extend_ttl` when the entry's estimated remaining TTL is still at or above `SCORE_TTL_THRESHOLD`, reducing ledger instruction cost for batch resubmissions to pre-warmed entries. Applies equally to `submit_score`, `submit_scores_batch`, and `submit_scores_batch_attested`, all of which route through the same `storage::set_score`.
- **Expiry-ordered rent-management index**: The tracked-entry index backing `get_expiring_entries`/`extend_entry_ttls` is now maintained as a queue ordered from least- to most-recently-touched (an entry moves to the back on every write or admin renewal), instead of insertion order. `get_expiring_entries` now stops scanning as soon as it reaches the first not-yet-due entry rather than always walking all `MAX_TRACKED_SCORE_ENTRIES` entries, and no longer needs its O(n²) selection sort since the queue is already in urgency order. Closes #422.

### Removed
- **`gdpr_accumulator` scaffold**: Removed the unwired, cryptographically unsound RSA-accumulator-style deletion-proof module (`generate_deletion_witness`, `verify_deletion_proof`, `accumulator_update`). It was never called from `clear_score`/`clear_score_history`, used a trivially factorable `u64` modulus in place of RSA, and XOR-folded bytes in place of a real hash. GDPR erasure is handled by plain storage deletion (`storage::clear_score_history`/`storage::clear_score`) only — there is currently no cryptographic non-membership proof accompanying deletion. A sound accumulator or Merkle-based scheme may be reintroduced later, properly wired and documented. Closes #395.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-22

This version corresponds to on-chain `CONTRACT_VERSION = 3`. It merges all the advanced features introduced in recent pull requests (hysteresis, score embargo, score floor, batch attestation, and consensus scoring).

### Added
- **Hysteresis layer**: Added `set_hysteresis_margin`, `get_hysteresis_margin`, and `is_in_risk_band` functions to mitigate boundary event oscillations by enforcing exit threshold margins.
- **Score Embargo**: Added `set_score_embargo`, `lift_score_embargo`, and `is_embargoed` functions to block read queries on specific wallets.
- **Score Submission Floor**: Added `set_score_floor_policy`, `get_score_floor_policy`, `get_historical_max_score`, and `override_score_floor` to prevent reputation-laundering attacks on high-risk wallets.
- **Batch Attestation (Merkle-Root Verification)**: Added `submit_scores_batch_attested` to verify an entire batch of score submissions using a single secp256k1 signature over a domain-separated Merkle root. Added the `batch_attested` capability to `supports_interface`.
- **Consensus Scoring**: Added `submit_consensus_score` and `set_consensus_config` / `get_consensus_config` functions to derive an on-chain median score from multiple attested model outputs.
- **Time-weighted Exponential Decay**: Added `set_decay_rate` / `get_decay_rate` and `get_effective_score` to enable live decay adjustments based on score age.
- **Wallet Relationship Graph**: Added `add_counterparty_link`, `remove_counterparty_link`, `get_counterparties`, and `get_contagion_depth` to map high-risk connections on-chain.
- **Wallet Score Delegation**: Added `set_score_delegate`, `remove_score_delegate`, and `get_score_delegate` fallback queries.
- **Confidence-Gated Gate**: Added `query_risk_gate_with_confidence` and `set_global_min_confidence` / `get_global_min_confidence` to enforce minimum confidence floors. Registered under capability `cgate`.
- **Model Version Stats**: Added `get_model_version_stats` and `get_all_model_versions` to monitor performance metrics.
- **Fee Withdrawal**: Added `withdraw_fees` and `set_fee_token` / `get_fee_token` to support SEP-41 token fee collection.
- **Pair Pausing**: Added `set_pair_paused`, `is_pair_paused`, and `get_paused_pairs` for surgical asset-pair pausing.
- **Admin Signer Set (M-of-N)**: Added `add_admin_signer`, `remove_admin_signer`, and `set_admin_threshold` functions to support multi-sig admin actions.

### Changed
- `query_risk_gate` now respects active score embargoes, hysteresis bands, and score delegates.

### What Broke
- **Admin Multisig Signatures**: Functions that require admin privileges (e.g. `set_history_max_depth`, `set_pair_weight`, `transfer_admin`, `cancel_admin_transfer`, `pause`, `unpause`, `set_watchlist`, `set_escalation_threshold`, `reset_breach_count`, `set_risk_threshold`, `set_jump_threshold`) now require an `admin_signers: Vec<Address>` parameter.
- **Service Multisig Signatures**: `submit_score` now takes `signers: Vec<Address>` as its first parameter to support M-of-N threshold service authorizations.

### Migration Guide
- **Ingestion Pipeline**: Update calls to `submit_score` to include the `signers` array as the first argument. If using legacy single-service authorization, pass an empty vector (`Vec::new(&env)`).
- **Admin Scripts**: Recompile deployment and administrative scripts to supply the `admin_signers` vector argument to all configured admin functions.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-12

This version corresponds to on-chain `CONTRACT_VERSION = 2`. It introduces batch submissions and cryptographic score attestation.

### Added
- **Payload Attestation**: Added `attestation: Option<ScoreAttestation>` to `submit_score` and functions `set_service_pubkey` / `get_service_pubkey` to verify the off-chain pipeline signatures using secp256k1.
- **Batch Submissions**: Added `submit_scores_batch` to allow registering multiple scores in one transaction.
- Added `supports_interface` capability detection for `score`, `history`, `batch`, `gate`, `aggr`, and `count`.

### Changed
- The return type of `submit_scores_batch` changed from `u32` (count of accepted entries) to the structured `BatchResult` detailing accept/reject metrics.

### What Broke
- **Batch Integration**: Any integrations calling `submit_scores_batch` and expecting a raw `u32` return value will fail due to the change to `BatchResult`.

### Migration Guide
- **Batch Consumers**: Update the client binding code to parse the structured `BatchResult` struct rather than treating the response as a primitive `u32`.

"""Source package integrity checks, run before test execution.

LedgerLens has already been bitten once by a class of bug this module exists
to catch early: a merge on ``config.py`` silently dropped several attributes
that call sites across the codebase still referenced (see the "Restored
config attributes" note in config.py). That failure mode — a bad merge or a
half-applied edit leaving a source tree that *looks* fine but is structurally
broken — doesn't show up as a clean, single test failure. It shows up as a
scatter of unrelated `AttributeError`/`ImportError` failures across the
suite, which is expensive to root-cause.

This module performs a fast, dependency-free, no-import structural sweep of
the source tree and reports every issue with a clear diagnosis, so a broken
tree fails once, loudly, with a pointer to the exact file — instead of as
noise across unrelated test failures. It never imports project code (so it
has no side effects and needs no dependencies installed), it only reads
files and parses them with ``ast``.

Checks performed, per file/package:

* **Missing ``__init__.py``** — a configured source package directory that
  contains ``.py`` files but has no ``__init__.py`` will silently fail to
  be treated as a regular package by some import machinery/tools.
* **Unresolved merge conflict markers** — ``<<<<<<<``, ``=======``,
  ``>>>>>>>`` left in a committed file after a bad merge/rebase.
* **Syntax errors** — every ``.py`` file must parse with ``ast.parse``.
* **Empty non-``__init__`` modules** — a zero-byte ``.py`` file (other than
  ``__init__.py``) usually indicates a truncated merge or a botched save.

Use :func:`check_source_package_integrity` directly, or via
``scripts/check_package_integrity.py`` / the ``pytest_sessionstart`` hook in
``tests/conftest.py`` (which runs this before any test collects, aborting
the whole run with a readable report on failure).

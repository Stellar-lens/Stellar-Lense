    \* ── Governance constants ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    \* GOV_EXEC_DELAY is the minimum number of ticks that must elapse between
    \* proposal creation and execution (the "timelock").  This prevents instant
    \* execution and is the property TLC proves: code cannot update before the
    \* executable time.
    \* GOV_PROPOSAL_TTL is the number of ticks after which an un-executed,
    \* un-vetoed proposal automatically expires.  Stale proposals that have
    \* passed expiry can never execute.
    \* Actions is the finite set of action identifiers the model explores.

    \* ── Consensus constants (issue #403) ────────────────────────────────────
    \* Signers is the set of model addresses that may commit/reveal.
    \* CONSENSUS_K is the minimum number of valid in-epsilon reveals required
    \* for a round to finalise (K-of-N agreement).
    \* CONSENSUS_EPSILON is the maximum pairwise score distance counted as
    \* "agreement" — mirrors the Rust DEFAULT_CONSENSUS_EPSILON / configurable
    \* epsilon stored in contract storage.
    \* REVEAL_WINDOW is the number of time-ticks within which a reveal must
    \* arrive after the corresponding commit (analogous to the Soroban
    \* temporary-storage TTL used as the reveal deadline in the Rust contract).

VARIABLES
    \* ── Governance proposal variables (issue: propose/veto/execute flows) ────
    \* gov_proposal_id       – 0 means no open proposal; >0 is the active id.
    \* gov_action            – opaque tag for the proposed action (e.g., a
    \*                         new config value); modelled as a natural.
    \* gov_proposed_at       – `now` when the proposal was created.
    \* gov_expiry            – the tick at which the proposal expires.
    \* gov_vetoed            – TRUE once any authorised vetoer has vetoed.
    \* gov_executed          – TRUE once the proposal has been executed.
    \* gov_replaced_by       – 0 if not replaced; the new proposal id otherwise.

    \* ── Token-bucket variables ──────────────────────────────────────────────
    \* tb_tokens[w]      – current token count for wallet w (across the single
    \*                     pair modelled here; extend to a function of pairs for
    \*                     a multi-pair model).
    \* tb_last_refill[w] – ledger timestamp of the last refill anchor.
    \* tb_capacity       – global burst capacity (max tokens per bucket).
    \* NOTE: The Rust implementation stores one bucket per (wallet, asset_pair).
    \*       For clarity this spec models a single canonical pair; all
    \*       multi-pair behaviour follows by symmetry.
    tb_tokens,
    tb_last_refill,
    tb_capacity,
    \* ── Consensus commit-reveal variables (issue #403) ──────────────────────
    \* Each signer independently commits a hash of (score || nonce) for a
    \* given (wallet, pair) before the reveal step.  We model a single
    \* canonical (wallet, pair) for clarity — the multi-pair generalisation
    \* follows by symmetry, exactly as for the token bucket above.
    \*
    \* cc_committed[s]   – TRUE iff signer s has an open (unexpired) commit.
    \* cc_commit_time[s] – the value of `now` when signer s committed.
    \* cc_score[s]       – the score signer s committed to (hidden until reveal;
    \*                     modelled in plain-text here because TLA+ has no
    \*                     cryptographic hiding — the invariants we care about
    \*                     are structural, not confidentiality-based).
    \* cc_revealed[s]    – TRUE iff signer s has successfully revealed in the
    \*                     current round.
    \* cc_finalized      – TRUE once the round has been finalized (K-of-N
    \*                     agreement reached and a score written).
    \* cc_final_score    – the consensus score written on finalization (median
    \*                     of the K agreeing reveals).

\* Mirrors the Rust expression:

\*   let refilled = min(tokens + refills, capacity);

\* The set of signers that have an open (committed but not yet expired) commit.
OpenCommitters ==
    { s \in Signers : cc_committed[s] /\ (now - cc_commit_time[s]) <= REVEAL_WINDOW }

\* The set of signers that have successfully revealed in this round.
RevealedSigners ==
    { s \in Signers : cc_revealed[s] }

\* Count of revealed signers whose score is within CONSENSUS_EPSILON of `ref_score`.
\* Used in the finalization check — mirrors the Rust loop that counts how many
\* valid reveals land within epsilon of each candidate pivot.
InEpsilonCount(ref_score) ==
    Cardinality({ s \in RevealedSigners : Abs(cc_score[s] - ref_score) <= CONSENSUS_EPSILON })

\* TRUE iff there exists at least one revealed score such that at least
\* CONSENSUS_K other revealed scores agree with it within epsilon.
\* Matches the Rust finalization check: for each candidate pivot, count
\* reveals within epsilon; if any pivot collects >= K, consensus passes.
ConsensusReached ==
    \E s \in RevealedSigners : InEpsilonCount(cc_score[s]) >= CONSENSUS_K

\* The consensus (median) score when ConsensusReached.  We model this as the
\* score of an arbitrary pivot signer whose epsilon-cluster is >= K, which is
\* a valid representative value under the invariants we care about.  A full
\* median computation in TLA+ would require sorting and is not needed to
\* capture the safety properties.
\* 
\* For a richer median model the user could extend cc_final_score to be the
\* exact middle element of the sorted agreeing cluster; the invariants below
\* hold for any selection from within the epsilon band.

\* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
\* GOVERNANCE ACTIONS  (propose / veto / execute / expiry / replacement)
\* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
\*
\* The governance flow modelled here mirrors a standard timelock pattern:
\*
\*   1. ProposeGov(id, action):
\*        Any party creates a proposal. The proposal is open from `now`
\*        and expires at `now + GOV_PROPOSAL_TTL`.  Execution is only
\*        permitted after `now + GOV_EXEC_DELAY` (the timelock delay).
\*        Guard: no other open (non-expired, non-vetoed, non-executed,
\*               non-replaced) proposal may exist simultaneously.
\*
\*   2. VetoGov:
\*        An authorised vetoer kills the open proposal before it executes.
\*        Guard: GovProposalOpen (must still be in the open window).
\*
\*   3. ExecuteGov:
\*        Executes the open proposal.
\*        Guard: GovProposalExecutable (open AND timelock elapsed).
\*        Safety property TLC proves: execution is impossible before
\*        `gov_proposed_at + GOV_EXEC_DELAY`.
\*
\*   4. ReplaceGov(new_id, new_action):
\*        Replaces an open proposal with a new one (emergency update path).
\*        The old proposal is marked replaced (gov_replaced_by = new_id)
\*        and can no longer execute; the new proposal starts its own
\*        timelock from the current tick.
\*        Guard: GovProposalOpen (the old proposal must still be alive).
\*
\* Expiry is not a separate action — it is implicit: once `now > gov_expiry`
\* the GovProposalOpen predicate becomes FALSE and neither Execute nor Replace
\* are enabled.  TLC verifies this by exhaustively exploring all interleavings
\* of TickTime with the governance actions.

\*     "slip" (matches the Rust `new_last_refill` calculation), and
\*   – score / hwm / breach_count / last_submit_time are updated as before.

\* CONSENSUS COMMIT-REVEAL ACTIONS  (issue #403)
\* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
\*
\* The three-phase flow modelled here directly mirrors the Rust contract:
\*
\*   Phase 1 – CommitConsensus(signer, value):
\*     Each signer independently records a commitment (the hash of their score
\*     and a nonce) in temporary storage.  In this abstract model we record the
\*     score in plain-text and simply track `cc_committed` and `cc_commit_time`
\*     so that the reveal-window guard can be checked structurally.
\*
\*   Phase 2 – RevealConsensus(signer, value):
\*     The signer reveals their pre-image.  The action is accepted only when:
\*       (a) the signer has an open commit (cc_committed[s] = TRUE), AND
\*       (b) the reveal arrives within REVEAL_WINDOW ticks of the commit, AND
\*       (c) the revealed score matches the committed score (hash check —
\*           modelled here by requiring the same score value since we store
\*           it in plain-text), AND
\*       (d) the round has not yet been finalized.
\*
\*   Phase 3 – FinalizeConsensus:
\*     Any party may trigger finalization once ConsensusReached holds.
\*     Finalization is an *atomic* step that writes cc_final_score and sets
\*     cc_finalized = TRUE.  A new round starts by resetting cc_committed,
\*     cc_revealed, etc.  (modelled as a separate ResetConsensusRound action).
\*
\* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

\* ── Action: CommitConsensus ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
\* Signer `s` commits a score `v` for the current round.
\* Guards:
\*   • The round must not yet be finalized (cc_finalized = FALSE).
\*   • The signer must not already have an open commitment (idempotency-guard;
\*     matches the Rust `CommitmentAlreadyExists` error).
CommitConsensus(s, v) ==
    /\ cc_finalized = FALSE
    /\ ~cc_committed[s]               \* no open commit for this signer
    /\ v \in Scores                   \* score is in the modelled domain
    /\ cc_committed'   = [cc_committed   EXCEPT ![s] = TRUE]
    /\ cc_commit_time' = [cc_commit_time EXCEPT ![s] = now]
    /\ cc_score'       = [cc_score       EXCEPT ![s] = v]
    /\ UNCHANGED <<score, hwm, breach_count, last_submit_time, embargo_expiry, delegate, now,

                   tb_tokens, tb_last_refill, tb_capacity,
                   cc_revealed, cc_finalized, cc_final_score>>

\* ── Action: RevealConsensus ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
\* Signer `s` reveals their previously committed score.
\* Guards (correspond 1-to-1 with Rust error codes):
\*   • cc_committed[s] = TRUE           (RevealWindowExpired / no commit)
\*   • now - cc_commit_time[s] <= REVEAL_WINDOW  (RevealWindowExpired)
\*   • ~cc_revealed[s]                  (replay protection)
\*   • cc_finalized = FALSE             (round already done)
\*   • The revealed score equals the committed score (CommitmentMismatch)
\*
\* On success the signer's cc_revealed flag is set.  Finalization is a
\* separate step so that TLC can explore interleavings of multiple reveals
\* before any one of them triggers finalization.
RevealConsensus(s) ==
    /\ cc_committed[s]                                   \* has open commit

    /\ cc_finalized = FALSE                              \* round open
    \* Score equality is trivially satisfied here because we stored the score
    \* in plain-text at commit time (no hash needed in the abstract model).
    \* The important structural check is the window and the prior-commit guard.

\* ── Action: ResetConsensusRound ──────────────────────────────────────────────
\* Starts a fresh consensus round.  In the Rust contract a new round is
\* implicitly started by the TTL expiry of temporary storage entries; here we
\* model the reset as an explicit action so TLC can verify that round
\* boundaries do not allow cross-round reveals.

\* ── Action: ExpireStaleCommit ────────────────────────────────────────────────
\* Models the Soroban temporary-storage TTL eviction: a signer's commitment is
\* silently dropped if the reveal window has elapsed without a reveal.
\* This lets TLC verify that an expired commit cannot be used to trigger a
\* reveal in a later tick.

\* ── Token-bucket invariants (new) ────────────────────────────────────────────

\* INV-TB-1  Tokens never exceed the current global capacity.
\* This holds even after SetBurstCapacity *reduces* the capacity —
\* existing over-capacity buckets are never refilled beyond the new cap
\* (RefillCount clamps to tb_capacity), so on the next SubmitScore the
\* bucket is written back within bounds.
\* NOTE: Between a capacity *reduction* and the next SubmitScore for a
\*       wallet, tb_tokens[w] may legitimately be above the *new* tb_capacity
\*       because the lazy-truncation contract (matching the Rust implementation)
\*       does not immediately rewrite stored buckets.  We therefore state the
\*       invariant in terms of what the wallet would *use* on its next call,
\*       i.e. RefillCount (which already clamps), rather than raw tb_tokens.
TokensNeverExceedCapacity ==
    \A w \in Wallets : RefillCount(w) <= tb_capacity

\* INV-TB-2  Tokens never go negative (trivially satisfied because tokens is
\*           a natural and we only store refilled-1 ≥ 0 after a successful
\*           SubmitScore, and we never decrement without a prior > 0 check).
TokensNonNegative ==
    \A w \in Wallets : tb_tokens[w] >= 0

\* INV-TB-3  After a capacity reduction, the *effective* available tokens on
\*           the next refill are capped at the new capacity.  Stated as a
\*           state invariant: RefillCount is always bounded by tb_capacity.
CapacityReductionCapsNextBurst ==
    \A w \in Wallets : RefillCount(w) <= tb_capacity

\* INV-TB-4  last_refill never drifts ahead of now.
RefillAnchorNotInFuture ==
    \A w \in Wallets : tb_last_refill[w] <= now

\* INV-TB-5  The global capacity is always within the configured bounds.
CapacityWithinBounds ==
    /\ tb_capacity >= MIN_CAPACITY

\* ── Consensus invariants (new — issue #403) ──────────────────────────────────

\* INV-CR-1  A value can only finalize when at least CONSENSUS_K valid reveals
\*           agree within CONSENSUS_EPSILON of each other.
\* This is the primary safety invariant: the finalized score must have come
\* from a cluster of at least K revealed scores, all within epsilon of the
\* chosen pivot.  No smaller quorum can ever produce a finalized score.
FinalScoreRequiresKReveals ==
    cc_finalized =>
        /\ Cardinality(RevealedSigners) >= CONSENSUS_K
        /\ InEpsilonCount(cc_final_score) >= CONSENSUS_K

\* INV-CR-2  A reveal without a prior matching commit is never accepted.
\* Formally: cc_revealed[s] = TRUE implies cc_committed[s] was TRUE at some
\* earlier point.  Because we model the commit bit monotonically (it is set
\* TRUE on CommitConsensus and cleared only by ExpireStaleCommit or
\* ResetConsensusRound, both of which also clear cc_revealed), the following
\* state-level check is sound: if a signer has revealed but their commit was
\* already cleared, cc_committed can be FALSE only after an explicit reset,
\* which also resets cc_revealed.  Therefore in any reachable state:
\*   cc_revealed[s] = TRUE  =>  cc_committed[s] = TRUE
NoRevealWithoutCommit ==
    \A s \in Signers : cc_revealed[s] => cc_committed[s]

\* INV-CR-3  A reveal is only accepted within the reveal window.
\* If a signer has revealed, their commit timestamp must be within
\* REVEAL_WINDOW ticks of the current `now`.
RevealOnlyWithinWindow ==
    \A s \in Signers :
        cc_revealed[s] => (now - cc_commit_time[s]) <= REVEAL_WINDOW

\* INV-CR-4  Once finalized, the final score is within CONSENSUS_EPSILON of
\*           at least CONSENSUS_K revealed scores.  This is a stronger restatement
\*           of INV-CR-1 that pins the epsilon band directly to cc_final_score.
FinalScoreWithinEpsilonOfCluster ==
    cc_finalized =>
        InEpsilonCount(cc_final_score) >= CONSENSUS_K

\* INV-CR-5  Commit timestamps are always <= now (no future-dated commits).
CommitTimestampNotInFuture ==
    \A s \in Signers : cc_commit_time[s] <= now

\* INV-CR-6  An expired (TTL-evicted) commit cannot be used to reveal.
\* Formally: if cc_committed[s] is FALSE and cc_revealed[s] is FALSE, no
\* reveal for that signer exists — the guard in RevealConsensus requires
\* cc_committed[s] = TRUE, so an evicted commit (cleared by ExpireStaleCommit)
\* can never produce a revealed entry.  This is an indirect invariant captured
\* by NoRevealWithoutCommit; we state it explicitly for documentation clarity.

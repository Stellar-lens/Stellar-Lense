"""Plugin boundary for LedgerLens data connectors.

Importing this package registers every built-in connector (SDEX trades, AMM
pool trades, order-book events, account activity) and exposes the shared
`registry` used to look connectors up by id. See `docs/connectors.md` for
the full contract and a guide to adding a new connector — in-tree or as an
installable out-of-tree plugin.

Typical usage::

    from ingestion.connectors import registry

    connector = registry.create("stellar-sdex-trades")
    trades = list(connector.load(since=some_datetime))
    df = connector.to_dataframe(trades)

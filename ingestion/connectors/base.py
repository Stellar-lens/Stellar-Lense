"""Typed plugin contract for LedgerLens data connectors.

A "connector" is the boundary between an external data source (Horizon
REST/SSE today; a different exchange API or chain indexer tomorrow) and the
rest of the ingestion pipeline. Everything downstream of a connector
(feature engineering, scoring, ``run_pipeline.py``) only ever sees the
pydantic record types in ``ingestion.data_models`` — never a source-specific
payload shape. That boundary is what lets a new data source be added
without editing ``detection/`` or ``run_pipeline.py`` at all.

To add a connector:
    1. Subclass ``DataConnector[YourRecordType]``.
    2. Declare a class-level ``metadata = ConnectorMetadata(...)``.
    3. Implement ``load()``.
    4. Register it — see ``ingestion.connectors.registry`` for both the
       in-tree (``@register_connector``) and out-of-tree (entry point)
       paths, and ``docs/connectors.md`` for a full walkthrough.

    Buffers events keyed by their paging_token/id and emits them in

    holds back events until the gap is filled or the timeout expires.

    Args:
        max_size: Maximum events to buffer before forcing a flush.
        gap_timeout_seconds: Seconds to wait for a gap to be filled before
            emitting out-of-order events anyway.

    Notes:
        Numeric paging tokens (e.g. Horizon cursor values) are compared by
        integer value so that "100" < "99" does not occur.  Non-numeric tokens
        fall back to lexicographic ordering via :func:`_sort_key`.

        Gap detection is only enforced for numeric tokens in strict consecutive
        order.  Non-numeric tokens are emitted in heap-min order without gap
        checking, since there is no natural predecessor relationship.

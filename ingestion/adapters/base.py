"""Normalized event contract for blockchain ingestion adapters.

LedgerLens ingests raw data from Stellar Horizon today (``ingestion/
horizon_fetcher.py``, ``ingestion/historical_loader.py``) and produces
chain-specific Pydantic models (``ingestion/data_models.py``: ``Trade``,
``OrderBookEvent``, ``AccountActivity``). Downstream feature engineering
and detection code (``features/``, ``detection/``) consume those models
directly.

That works while there is exactly one source chain, but it means every new
ingestion source (an EVM bridge counterpart, a second DEX, a different
Stellar-compatible network) would need to either shoehorn its data into the
existing Stellar-specific models or fork the feature engineering layer per
chain. Neither scales.

This module defines a chain-agnostic **normalized event contract**
(``NormalizedEvent``) and an **adapter contract** (``ChainAdapter``) that
any ingestion source implements to produce it. Feature engineering and
detection code that only needs the normalized shape (timestamp, accounts,
asset, amount, event type) can be written once against
``NormalizedEvent`` regardless of which chain produced the underlying raw
event; chain-specific detail is preserved losslessly in ``raw``.

This does not replace ``ingestion/data_models.py`` -- existing pipelines
that depend on ``Trade``/``OrderBookEvent``/``AccountActivity`` keep
working unchanged. ``StellarAdapter`` (see ``stellar_adapter.py``) adapts
those existing models into the normalized contract for consumers that want
the chain-agnostic shape.

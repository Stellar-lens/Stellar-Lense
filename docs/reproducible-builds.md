# Reproducible Builds

LedgerLens commits to a **reproducible-build guarantee**: any third party who
checks out the same source commit and builds with the pinned toolchain must
obtain a byte-identical WASM artifact.  This lets you independently verify
that the contract deployed on-chain matches the published source — without
trusting the deployer.

---

## Why this matters

A Soroban contract's on-chain identity is its **WASM hash** (the SHA-256 of the
contract bytecode installed via `update_current_contract_wasm` or the initial
deploy).  If a build is not reproducible, the only way to trust that the
deployed hash corresponds to this repository's source is to trust whoever ran
the deploy script.

Reproducibility closes that gap: anyone can compute the expected hash
themselves and compare it against the on-chain value with a public RPC call.

## Pinned build inputs

All inputs that affect WASM output determinism are locked:

| Input | Where pinned | Value |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Rust compiler version | `rust-toolchain.toml` | `1.81.0` |
| Cargo dependency tree | `Cargo.lock` (committed) | exact versions |
| Optimization level | `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` | `opt-level = "z"` |
| LTO | `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` | `lto = true` |
| Codegen units | `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` | `codegen-units = 1` |
| Symbol stripping | `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` | `strip = "symbols"` |
| Panic strategy | `Cargo.toml` `[profile.release]` | `panic = "abort"` |

> **Why Rust 1.81.0?**  `soroban-sdk 21.x` targets `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
> Rust 1.82 changed that target to enable the `reference-types` and
> `multi-value` WebAssembly proposals, which the Soroban host environment does
> not support.  `1.81.0` is the latest stable release that produces a valid,
> deployable Soroban WASM artifact.

## CI verification

Every push and pull request runs three dedicated CI jobs
(see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, jobs `repro-build-1`, `repro-build-2`,
`repro-verify`):

1. **`repro-build-1`** — fresh Ubuntu runner, no cargo cache, cold build.
2. **`repro-build-2`** — second fresh Ubuntu runner, no cargo cache, cold build.
3. **`repro-verify`** — downloads both artifacts and asserts their SHA-256
   digests are identical.  The job fails with a clear diff if they diverge.

This proves that two independent machines, starting from scratch, produce the
same binary from the same source commit.

---

## Local verification procedure

Use the steps below to independently reproduce the WASM artifact and compare it
against a deployed contract's on-chain hash.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install rustup (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# The rust-toolchain.toml at the repo root pins everything automatically.
# The first cargo command after checkout will download Rust 1.81.0 and the
# wasm32-unknown-unknown target.  You can also install it explicitly:
rustup toolchain install 1.81.0
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.81.0
```

### Step 1 — Check out the exact commit

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ledger-Lenz/Ledgerlens-contract.git
cd Ledgerlens-contract

# Replace <COMMIT_SHA> with the Git commit that was deployed on-chain.
# For a tagged release, use the tag instead: git checkout contract-v1.2.3
git checkout <COMMIT_SHA>
```

### Step 2 — Build the contract

```bash
# --locked    enforces the committed Cargo.lock; no network resolution allowed.
# --release   uses the deterministic [profile.release] from Cargo.toml.
cargo build \
  --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --release \
  -p ledgerlens-score \
  --locked
```

### Step 3 — Compute the SHA-256 hash of the local artifact

```bash
sha256sum target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/ledgerlens_score.wasm
```

Example output:
```
a1b2c3d4e5f6...  target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/ledgerlens_score.wasm
```

### Step 4 — Retrieve the on-chain WASM hash

Use the Soroban / Stellar RPC to fetch the contract's installed WASM hash.  The
easiest way is via the Stellar CLI:

```bash
# Replace <CONTRACT_ID> with the deployed contract's address (C...)
# Replace <NETWORK>     with testnet or mainnet
stellar contract info \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network <NETWORK>
```

The output includes a `wasm_hash` field — that is the SHA-256 hash of the
bytecode currently installed on-chain.

Alternatively, using `curl` against Horizon or the RPC directly:

```bash
# Soroban RPC getLedgerEntries — contract code entry
curl -s https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getLedgerEntries",
    "params": {
      "keys": ["<CONTRACT_CODE_XDR_KEY>"]
    }
  }' | jq '.result.entries[0].xdr'
```

> **Note**: the on-chain `wasm_hash` is the hash of the *raw* WASM bytes before
> any Soroban optimization step.  If you apply `stellar contract optimize` (or
> the legacy `soroban contract optimize`) after the build step, hash the
> **unoptimized** artifact (`ledgerlens_score.wasm`) to match the on-chain
> hash, unless the deploy was done with the optimized artifact — in which case
> hash the optimized one.  The deployment logs or `deploy.sh` output will
> indicate which artifact was deployed.

### Step 5 — Compare

```bash
# Hash from Step 3 (local build)
LOCAL_HASH="a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

# Hash from Step 4 (on-chain)
ONCHAIN_HASH="a1b2c3d4e5f6..."

if [ "$LOCAL_HASH" = "$ONCHAIN_HASH" ]; then
  echo "✓ Verified: local build matches on-chain deployment."
else
  echo "✗ MISMATCH: hashes differ."
  echo "  Local:   $LOCAL_HASH"
  echo "  On-chain: $ONCHAIN_HASH"
fi
```

If the hashes match, the deployed contract bytecode is confirmed to correspond
to the source at `<COMMIT_SHA>` in this repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Hashes differ

| Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Wrong Rust version | Run `rustc --version` and confirm it prints `rustc 1.81.0`.  Delete `~/.rustup/toolchains/` and reinstall if needed. |
| Wrong source commit | Run `git log -1` and confirm the commit matches the one used for deployment. |
| Cargo.lock was regenerated | Run `git diff Cargo.lock`.  Should be empty.  If not, restore it with `git checkout Cargo.lock`. |
| Post-build optimization applied | Hash the optimized artifact if the deployment used `soroban contract optimize`. |
| Host-specific build metadata | Some Rust targets embed absolute paths in debug info.  Confirm `debug = 0` is set in `[profile.release]` (it is — see `Cargo.toml`). |

### Build fails with `error[E0463]: can't find crate for 'core'`

The `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is not installed for the 1.81.0 toolchain.
Fix:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.81.0
```

### Build fails with feature errors on Rust ≥ 1.82

The `rust-toolchain.toml` in this repository pins to `1.81.0`, which `rustup`
respects automatically.  If you are seeing this error, your environment is
overriding the toolchain.  Unset `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` and `RUSTC` environment
variables and try again.

## Deployed contract registry

Published WASM hashes for each network are recorded in deployment releases (GitHub Releases tab).
Cross-reference the release tag against the Git commit and the on-chain hash to
establish a full chain of custody from source → build → deployment.

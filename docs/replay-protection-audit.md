# Replay-Protection Audit Report

## Executive Summary

An audit of the two independent commit-reveal mechanisms in `contracts/ledgerlens-score` was conducted to evaluate replay attack vulnerability, scope binding, and storage isolation.

**Audit Outcome:** **No gap found.**
All tested replay attack vectors (replaying in later reveal windows, replaying across asset pairs, replaying twice, and cross-mechanism replay) are correctly rejected by existing storage scoping keys, key deletion post-reveal, and storage namespace isolation.

## 1. Commitment Scoping Trace

### Mechanism 1: Multi-Model Consensus Commit-Reveal (`commit_consensus` / `reveal_consensus`)

* **Functions:** `commit_consensus` (line 692), `reveal_consensus` (line 712)
* **Storage Key:** `DataKeyC::ConsensusCommitment(model: Address, wallet: Address, asset_pair: Symbol)` in Soroban `temporary()` storage.
* **Storage Scoping:** Keyed explicitly by **`model` (signer) + `wallet` + `asset_pair`**.
* **Storage Lifetime:** Temporary TTL bounded by `get_reveal_window_secs(env)`.
* **On-Chain Key Deletion:** `reveal_consensus` explicitly removes the storage key (`remove_consensus_commitment`) immediately upon verifying a valid commitment.
* **Commitment Hash Byte Construction:**
  * `computed_hash = sha256(score.to_be_bytes() || nonce.to_be_bytes())` (12 bytes buffer: 4 bytes `u32` score + 8 bytes `u64` nonce).
* **Scoping Attributes Summary:**
  * **Wallet:** Included in storage key (`DataKeyC::ConsensusCommitment`).
  * **Asset Pair:** Included in storage key (`DataKeyC::ConsensusCommitment`).
  * **Signer / Model:** Included in storage key (`DataKeyC::ConsensusCommitment`).
  * **Nonce:** Included in `sha256` commitment payload.
  * **Window / Epoch:** Enforced by temporary storage TTL eviction and `remove_consensus_commitment` on consumption.

### Mechanism 2: Finality Buffer Commit-Reveal (`auto_commit_score` / `commit_pending_score` / `cancel_pending_score`)

* **Functions:** `submit_score` (holding pending entry), `auto_commit_score` / `commit_pending_score` (line 560), `cancel_pending_score` (line 629).
* **Storage Key:** `DataKeyB::PendingScore(wallet: Address, asset_pair: Symbol)` in Soroban `persistent()` storage.
* **Storage Scoping:** Keyed explicitly by **`wallet` + `asset_pair`**.
* **Data Structure Fields:** `PendingScoreEntry` containing `score`, `benford_flag`, `ml_flag`, `submitted_at`, `confidence`, `model_version`, `timestamp`, `commit_after`, `submitted_by` (signer Address), and `commitment` (`Option<BytesN<32>>`).
* **Promote & Clear:** `commit_pending_score` moves the pending score to live storage (`DataKey::Score`) and immediately calls `clear_pending_score(&env, &wallet, &asset_pair)`, deleting the pending key.
* **Admin Cancellation:** `cancel_pending_score` requires Admin quorum authorization and deletes `DataKeyB::PendingScore`.
* **Scoping Attributes Summary:**
  * **Wallet:** Included in storage key (`DataKeyB::PendingScore`).
  * **Asset Pair:** Included in storage key (`DataKeyB::PendingScore`).
  * **Signer:** Recorded inside `PendingScoreEntry.submitted_by`.
  * **Nonce:** N/A (time-gated administrative hold window).
  * **Window / Epoch:** Enforced by `commit_after` timestamp requirement (`now >= commit_after`) and immediate key deletion upon commit or cancellation.

## 2. Storage Key & Namespace Isolation Analysis

* **Consensus Commitments** are stored in `DataKeyC::ConsensusCommitment(model: Address, wallet: Address, asset_pair: Symbol)` under Soroban's **temporary** storage space.
* **Pending Scores** are stored in `DataKeyB::PendingScore(wallet: Address, asset_pair: Symbol)` under Soroban's **persistent** storage space.
* **Namespace Protection:** Soroban contract storage separates keys by enum variant types (`DataKeyC` vs `DataKeyB`) and storage sub-trees (`temporary()` vs `persistent()`).
* **Design-Level Guarantee:** No genuine cross-mechanism replay vector exists to test against at runtime because the two mechanisms use structurally distinct storage keys and storage subtrees by construction. A commitment or pending entry in one path can never be read, misinterpreted, or consumed by the other. This structural isolation is a compile-time design guarantee rather than something demonstrated by runtime replay attempts.

## 3. Replay Test Scenarios & Results

All test scenarios were implemented in [`contracts/ledgerlens-score/src/test_replay_audit.rs`](file:///home/mxr/Documents/Ledgerlens-contract/contracts/ledgerlens-score/src/test_replay_audit.rs). 

Tests **1a, 1b, 2a, and 3b** represent legitimate adversarial replay attempts. Tests **2b and 3a** function as runtime storage isolation correctness checks demonstrating that independent storage entries operate concurrently without state interference.

| # | Scenario | Classification | Setup / State | Replay / Operation Attempt | Result | Mechanism Behavior / Error Returned |
|---|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| 1a | Replaying `reveal_consensus` twice | Adversarial Replay | Active commitment | Call `reveal_consensus` a second time after initial successful reveal | **Replay Rejected** | `Error::RevealWindowExpired` (Key deleted on first reveal) |
| 1b | Replaying old commitment/nonce in new window | Adversarial Replay | Active commitment for new score (80) | Attempt reveal using old score (70) & old nonce | **Replay Rejected** | `Error::CommitmentMismatch` |
| 1c | Replaying `commit_pending_score` twice | Adversarial Replay | Active pending score | Call `commit_pending_score` a second time | **Replay Rejected** | `Error::NoPendingScore` (Pending entry cleared on first commit) |
| 2a | Cross-asset pair consensus reveal | Adversarial Replay | Active commitments for both `pair_a` (`hash_a`) and `pair_b` (`hash_b`) | Attempt to satisfy `pair_b` reveal using `pair_a` score, nonce, and hash | **Replay Rejected** | `Error::CommitmentMismatch` (`hash_a != hash_b`) |
| 2b | Cross-asset pair pending score commit | Storage Isolation Check | Active pending scores for both `pair_a` (score 50) and `pair_b` (score 90) | Execute `commit_pending_score(wallet, pair_b)` | **Isolation Verified** | Commits `pair_b` score (90) only; `pair_a` score (50) is isolated in its own key slot and remains pending |
| 3a | Cross-mechanism: `commit_consensus` into `commit_pending_score` | Storage Isolation Check | Active `commit_consensus` (score 90) & active pending score (score 50 carrying consensus hash) | Execute `commit_pending_score` to attempt committing consensus score | **Isolation Verified** | Commits pending score (50) to live storage; consensus commitment (90) remains untouched in `DataKeyC` temporary storage |
| 3b | Cross-mechanism: `submit_score` into `reveal_consensus` | Adversarial Replay | Active pending score (`hash_pending`, score 50) & active consensus commitment (`hash_consensus`, score 90) | Call `reveal_consensus` using pending score payload (score 50, `nonce_pending`) | **Replay Rejected** | `Error::CommitmentMismatch` (`hash_pending != hash_consensus`) |

## 4. Conclusion

The audit confirms that commitments in both mechanisms are strictly isolated by their storage keys, data types, and lifecycle bounds:
- **Cross-Pair Replay:** Attempts to satisfy a reveal or commit for `pair_b` using valid inputs from `pair_a` fail because each asset pair keys its own storage slot (`DataKeyC` or `DataKeyB`) and validates hashes against that specific pair's committed hash.
- **Cross-Mechanism Replay & Storage Isolation:** The two mechanisms use structurally distinct storage keys (`DataKeyC` vs `DataKeyB`) and subtrees (`temporary` vs `persistent`), providing a design-level guarantee against cross-mechanism state consumption. Adversarial cross-reveal attempts are rejected with `Error::CommitmentMismatch`.

No security gap was identified.

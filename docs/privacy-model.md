# Differential Privacy Model

`get_private_aggregate_score` provides an ε-differentially-private variant of
the cross-asset aggregate risk score query.  The noise mechanism is the
**discrete Laplace mechanism** (the integer analogue of the classic Laplace
mechanism), calibrated to sensitivity 100 — the full output range of the
aggregate score (0–100).

## Definition

A randomised query `M` satisfies **ε-differential privacy** if for all
adjacent databases `D` and `D'` (differing by a single wallet's score), and
for all output sets `S`:

```
Pr[M(D) ∈ S] ≤ exp(ε) × Pr[M(D') ∈ S]
```

The privacy budget `ε` controls the privacy–utility trade-off:
lower values provide stronger privacy guarantees but add more noise.

## Noise Mechanism

### Laplace Inverse‑CDF Sampling

Noise is drawn from a discrete Laplace distribution `Lap(0, b)` with scale

```
b = sensitivity / ε = 100 / ε
```

using the inverse-CDF (quantile) method:

```
noise = sign × Lap_magnitude
sign = ±1 with equal probability
magnitude = floor(b × (−ln(u)))
```

where `u` is a uniform random variate in `(0, 1)`.  This is the standard
**geometric mechanism** for integer-valued queries.

### Deterministic PRNG

On-chain smart contracts have no access to true entropy.  Instead, the noise
is derived from a **deterministic pseudo-random function** of the ledger
sequence number (a monotonically increasing value that changes each ledger
close) plus a caller-provided `seed` argument:

```text
prng = SHA-256(ledger_seq || seed || sensitivity || epsilon_scaled || "DPRN")
```

This means:

- **Reproducible** — calling `get_private_aggregate_score` at the same
  ledger sequence with the same `seed` produces identical output, which
  makes integration testing predictable.
- **Non-repeating across ledgers** — unless the caller reuses the same
  `seed` on the same ledger sequence, the noise will differ.
- **Caller-controlled seed** — callers can supply different `seed` values
  even within the same ledger to obtain independent noise samples.

### Clamping

Noise is clamped to `±3 × b` (i.e. `±3 × sensitivity / ε`) before being
added to the exact aggregate score.  The final noised result is clamped to
`[0, 100]` to stay within the valid score range.

## Configuration

| Function | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `set_privacy_epsilon(epsilon_scaled)` | `epsilon_scaled = ε × 100` | Admin sets the privacy budget. `100` → ε = 1.0, `1` → ε = 0.01. `0` disables noise. |
| `get_privacy_epsilon()` | — | Returns the current `epsilon_scaled` value. Defaults to `0` (no privacy). |

## Sensitivity

The L1 sensitivity of the aggregate score query is **100** — the full output
range.  Because the aggregate is a weighted average of per-pair scores each
bounded to [0, 100], changing a single wallet's score by at most 100 can
change the average by at most 100.  Using the full range as sensitivity is
conservative (it slightly over-estimates the true sensitivity for wallets
with many pairs) and ensures the mechanism satisfies ε-DP regardless of the
number of asset pairs.

## Usage

```rust
// Query private aggregate
let private_score: u32 = client.get_private_aggregate_score(&wallet, &seed);
```

## Limits and Caveats

1. **Deterministic PRNG is not true randomness.**  An adversary who knows
   the contract source code and the ledger state can reproduce the noise
   value exactly.  This is inherent to any on-chain "randomness" on Soroban
   and is the standard trade-off.  The differential privacy guarantee is
   still meaningful because the noise is *statistically* calibrated —
   even a deterministic adversary sees a value drawn from the correct
   distribution at the time of the call.

2. **ε is a parameter, not a proof.**  The contract does not enforce a
   privacy budget composition bound (e.g., no sequential composition
   tracking).  Integrators calling `get_private_aggregate_score` multiple
   times for the same wallet will accumulate a total privacy spend of
   `k × ε` after `k` queries (by sequential composition).  Calling
   contracts should track their own privacy budget if they need a
   bounded total spend.

3. **Round‑off from clamping.**  When the noise is large enough to push the
   result outside [0, 100], clamping truncates the distribution, but the
   output remains within the valid score range and the privacy guarantee is
   preserved (clamping is a post-processing step and does not increase the
   privacy loss).

4. **No per‑pair private query.**  Only the cross-asset aggregate query
   (`get_private_aggregate_score`) has a private variant.  The per-pair
   `get_score` query is exact and not noise-calibrated.

## Example

```text
sensitivity = 100
ε = 1.0       →  epsilon_scaled = 100
b = 100 / 1.0 = 100

Noise bounds: ±300

Exact score:  70
Noised score: 70 + Lap(0, 100) → e.g. 42 or 91
              (always clamped to [0, 100])
```

## Data Retention Boundaries

This section maps every on-chain stored field and event to its retention and deletion
expectations, clarifying what can be deleted, what remains immutable, and what operators
must handle outside the contract.

### On-Chain Persistent Storage

| Field | Retention | Deletion | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Latest Risk Score (wallet, pair) | Indefinite until cleared | Operator-initiated via `clear_score()` | Immutable after submission; only full clearance removes it |
| Score History (wallet, pair) | Configurable max-depth | Circular FIFO buffer; old entries evicted at `get_history_max_depth()` | Oldest entries removed when buffer fills; cleared via `clear_score_history()` |
| Aggregate Score (wallet) | Recalculated on each submission | Cleared when all pair scores cleared | Derived from all pair scores; no independent TTL |
| Score Embargo | Set per `set_score_embargo()`; expires at timestamp or indefinite | Manually via `lift_score_embargo()` or batch `batch_lift_score_embargo()` | Operator responsibility: track expiry offline |
| Signer List (multi-sig) | Indefinite until member removal | Removed via `remove_service_signer()` | All signers remain active until explicitly deregistered |
| Pair Weights | Indefinite until reset | Reset via `set_pair_weight()` or `reset_pair_weight()` | Admin-only; used to recompute aggregate scores |
| Admin / Service Address | Indefinite (or rotated) | Rotated via `transfer_admin()` or `set_service()` | Immutable until admin explicitly rotates |

### On-Chain Temporary Storage (TTL-Bounded)

| Field | TTL | Automatic Expiry | Manual Deletion |
|-------|-----|------------------|-----------------|
| Pending Scores (finality buffer) | `finality_depth` ledgers | Yes, after finality period | `cancel_pending_score()` or `veto_score()` |
| Open Disputes | Configurable reveal window + challenge period | Yes, on timeout | `resolve_dispute()` or manual operator cleanup |
| Service Silence Alert | Heartbeat threshold seconds | Yes, auto-expired from temp storage | Resolved via `set_last_service_activity()` |

### Off-Chain Responsibilities (Not Managed by Contract)

The following data is **NOT stored in the contract** and must be managed by operators:

| Data | Storage | Retention | Deletion | Operator Responsibility |
|------|---------|-----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Original submission payloads | Off-chain indexer | Operator policy | Operator logs/archives | Archive according to compliance policy |
| Benford/ML model internals | Off-chain LedgerLens service | Model version lifecycle | Deprecated models archived | Keep audit trail for model version history |
| Decision context (transactions, wallet labels) | Off-chain knowledge base | Operator policy | On incident closure | Map scores to real-world incidents; retain per SLA |
| Breach / score-jump alerts | Off-chain SIEM or logging system | Operator policy | After investigation | Integrate with incident response workflow |
| User-visible explanations | Off-chain frontend/API | Operator policy | Operator discretion | Never auto-delete; user consent required |

### Event Emission and Indexing

All events are **immutable and permanent** once committed to the ledger. Events serve as an audit trail.

| Event | Emitted on | Indexed by | Retention Note |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `score_submitted` | Every score submission | Off-chain indexer; audit log | Permanent; indexes every accepted score |
| `score_cleared` | `clear_score()` call | Audit log | Permanent; proves deletion intent |
| `score_history_cleared` | `clear_score_history()` call | Audit log | Permanent; proves buffer wipe |
| `breach` | Score ≥ risk threshold | Alert system | Permanent; triggers incident response |
| `embargo_set`, `embargo_lifted` | Embargo state changes | Compliance log | Permanent; tracks regulatory holds |
| `score_delta` | Score value changes | Trend analysis | Permanent; tracks wallet risk evolution |

### Immutable vs. Mutable Fields

#### Immutable (Set Once, Read-Only)
- Contract version (`get_version`)
- Initial admin address (unless rotated)
- Event schema version (bumped only on breaking changes)

#### Mutable (Admin-Controlled)
- Risk threshold (`set_threshold`)
- Cooldown period (`set_cooldown_secs`)
- History max-depth (`set_history_max_depth`)
- Pair weights (`set_pair_weight`)
- Service address (`set_service`)
- Admin address (via `transfer_admin`)

#### Ephemeral (Transient Storage)
- Pending scores (cleared after finality buffer expires)
- Open disputes (auto-expired or manually resolved)
- Service heartbeat state (resets on activity)

### Compliance and User Rights

#### GDPR / Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")
1. **Public scores cannot be deleted retroactively** — they are immutable and public.
2. **Operators must implement a two-step process:**
   - Use `clear_score()` and `clear_score_history()` to remove on-chain data.
   - Publish a `score_cleared` event to notify off-chain indexers.
3. **Off-chain data (logs, archives, ML models)** — operators handle separately per policy.
4. **Cannot revoke past events** — they remain on the immutable ledger forever.

#### Incident Investigation Window
Operators should **retain full history for at least 6 months** (configurable per policy):
- Latest score and history buffer (via contract)
- Flagged wallets and embargoes (via events)
- Signer accuracy records and model versions

### Resource Usage and Bounded Behavior

#### Score History Buffer
- **Bounded size**: `HistoryMaxDepth` (default 128, configurable).
- **FIFO eviction**: oldest entry removed when buffer is full.
- **No pagination needed**: single read returns all buffered entries.
- **Manual override**: `clear_score_history()` wipes the entire buffer in one call.

#### Embargo Index
- **Bounded size**: `MAX_EMBARGOED_WALLETS` (prevents runaway growth).
- **Incremental maintenance**: O(1) add/remove for individual embargoes.
- **Batch cleanup**: `batch_lift_score_embargo()` and `revoke_all_embargoes()` for bulk operations.

#### Event Limits
- Events have no on-contract limit; off-chain indexers must enforce rate limits.
- Event topics are immutable once emitted; re-indexing does not change past events.

### Audit and Verification Checklist

For compliance audits, verify:

- [ ] Latest score and embargo status match current on-chain state.
- [ ] History buffer contains expected number of entries (≤ `history_max_depth`).
- [ ] Score-cleared events correspond to user deletion requests.
- [ ] Embargo-set events correspond to regulatory holds with expiry.
- [ ] No field updates bypass the admin multi-sig check.
- [ ] Service silence alerts were actioned within SLA.
- [ ] Pending scores were resolved within finality buffer.

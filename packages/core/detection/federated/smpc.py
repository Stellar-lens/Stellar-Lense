"""Additive secret sharing for privacy-preserving gradient exchange (Issue-138).

Implements a 2-of-3 additive secret sharing scheme over float gradient tensors
using numpy.  Three shares are generated such that share_1 + share_2 + share_3
equals the original gradient.  Any 2 of 3 partial sums allow reconstruction.

Usage (client side):
    shares = split_gradient(gradient, n_shares=3)
    # send shares[i] to aggregator_i

Usage (aggregator side):
    partial_sum = aggregate_shares(received_shares)
    # exchange partial sums with other aggregators, then reconstruct:
    gradient = reconstruct_gradient([partial_sum_0, partial_sum_1])

Security properties:
  - No single aggregator can reconstruct the original gradient from its share alone.
  - Reconstruction requires any 2 of 3 partial sums (threshold=2).
  - A share commitment (SHA-256 hash) allows clients to verify inclusion.

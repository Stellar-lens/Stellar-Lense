"""Cache invalidation primitives for derived feature data.

``FeatureCache`` (see ``detection/feature_cache.py``) and ``FeatureStore``
(see ``features/feature_store.py``) cache *derived* values -- feature
matrices, wallet-graph aggregates, Benford window statistics -- that are
computed from one or more *upstream sources*: raw trade/order-book events,
a wallet's account state, a feature-engineering config version, or an
upstream model artifact version.

Today, invalidation of those derived values is handled ad hoc: each cache
implements its own TTL and callers must remember to call ``invalidate()``
directly whenever an upstream source changes. That works for a single flat
cache, but breaks down as soon as one derived value depends on another
(e.g. a wallet-graph feature that is itself derived from per-pair Benford
statistics) -- there is no shared mechanism for propagating "this upstream
source changed" into "these N derived cache entries are now stale", and no
audit trail explaining *why* a given entry was evicted.

This module provides that shared mechanism as a small, dependency-free
primitive that any cache in the codebase can opt into:

* :class:`DependencyGraph` -- tracks which derived keys were computed from
  which source keys, and computes the transitive closure of keys to evict
  when a source changes.
* :class:`InvalidationRegistry` -- a thread-safe registry that pairs a
  ``DependencyGraph`` with a pluggable list of *evictor* callbacks (one per
  backing cache), a versioned-fingerprint staleness check, and a bounded
  audit log of invalidation events for diagnostics.
* :class:`CacheInvalidationError` -- raised when an invalidation callback
  fails, wrapping the offending key and cache name so failures are
  attributable instead of silently swallowed.
* :func:`fingerprint` -- stable hash of an arbitrary set of "version"
  inputs (config hash, upstream row count, schema version, ...), used to
  detect staleness without an explicit invalidation call.

Usage::

    from detection.cache_invalidation import InvalidationRegistry

    registry = InvalidationRegistry()
    registry.register_cache("wallet_feature_cache", evict=feature_cache.invalidate)

    # Record that the wallet-graph feature for `wallet` was derived from
    # the raw trade source `trade:wallet` and the current config version.
    registry.record_dependency(
        derived_key=wallet,
        sources={f"trade:{wallet}", "config:feature_engineering"},
        cache_name="wallet_feature_cache",
    )

    # Later, when new trades land for `wallet`:
    registry.invalidate_source(f"trade:{wallet}", reason="new_trade_ingested")

    # Diagnostics: why was a key evicted?
    registry.explain(wallet)
